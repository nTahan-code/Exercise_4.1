For the ethical case I chose to examine a retailer selling your personal information to others for profit. There are several Ethical Quandaries that are brought up with this topic. The most prevalent is the consumer's right to privacy. In our culture it is assumed that individuals are entitled to a certain amount of privacy. Any violations of this right could disrupt several systems in this scenario. If the public found out that a retailer sold purchase information to advertisers this could hurt the public's perception of that organization. 

Imagine a scenario where a person gets into a minor car accident. There was no serious damage to either car, and there are no injuries. The person then takes their car to an autoshop to repair cosmetic damages and inspect the car. If the autoshop sold the person's information to his insurance company, his premiums could go up. 

Not only do you have to account for the collection of personal information, but the transfer of personal information could also  be just as concerning. A third party could steal people's personal information. Potential employers could view candidates spending habits and discriminate based on that information.
